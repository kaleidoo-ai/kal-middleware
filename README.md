`kal-middleware` is a Python package designed for FastAPI applications to provide robust JWT and Service-to-Service (STS) authentication using Firebase and Google Identity Platform.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures that the JWTs are valid and checks user roles against provided configurations.
- **STS Authentication**: Validates tokens for service-to-service communication ensuring that only verified services can communicate.

## Installation

Install `kal-middleware` using pip:

```bash
pip install kal_middleware
```

# Usage

## JWT Authentication

To add JWT authentication to your FastAPI endpoints, you can use the `jwt_authenticated` decorator provided by `kal-middleware`. This decorator checks if the JWT token in the `Authorization` header is valid and whether the user has the appropriate role based on a configuration map.

Here's an example of how to apply the `jwt_authenticated` decorator:

```python
from kal_middleware.jwt import jwt_authenticated

# Define a function to retrieve the user's role based on their user ID
def get_user_role_function(user_id: str):
    # Implement your logic to retrieve the user's role
    # If the user not found, return "".
    return "user_role"

# Define a configuration map specifying services, actions, and required permissions
config_map = {
    "service": {
        "action": {
            "permissions": ["user_role", "admin_role"]
        }
    }
}

# if there is specific variable in the body that needed checks of who access its data only
def check_access(firebase_uid, body):
    # check in the db the user and his parameters
    # for example if in the db the user with that exactly firebase_uid is:
    user = {
        "firebase_uid": "12345",
        "org_id": "12345"
    }
    return body["org_id"] == user["org_id"]

@app.get("/your-route")
@jwt_authenticated(get_user_role_function, config_map, check_access)
async def your_route_function():
    # Your route logic
    return {"message": "This is a protected route"}
```

### STS Authentication
For service-to-service (STS) authentication using Google's Identity Platform, you can use the `sts_authenticated` decorator. This ensures that the calling service's token is verified to enable secure interactions between services.

Here's how to use the `sts_authenticated` decorator in your FastAPI app:
- Make sure first you have env variable named `ALLOWED_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` with the following structure: `example1@.gserviceaccount.com, example2@.gserviceaccount.com`
```python
from kal_middleware.sts import sts_authenticated

@app.get("/secure-service")
@sts_authenticated
async def secure_service_function():
    # Logic that requires service-to-service authentication
    return {"message": "Service-to-service call is authenticated"}
```
This configuration will parse and verify the Authorization header, ensuring that only requests with a verified bearer token can access the endpoint.
